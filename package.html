            <h3>Accomodation</h3>
            <p>The travel and tourism industries also both contain the accommodation sector, with people requiring overnight accommodation for varying lengths of time. The accommodation industry offers a variety of different options for customers, catering to different tastes, budgets and requirements. In addition to providing shelter and a place to sleep, many companies in the accommodation sector also provide a range of other services.

            <h3>Food & Beverage</h3>
            <p>Food and drinks are basic human needs and the food and beverage industry caters these needs among tourists and travellers. Again, there are a wide range of different company types that fall within this sector, providing customers with an array of different options. It is also worth noting that the food and beverage industry also provides opportunities for tourists and travellers to socialise with friends, or meet new people.
